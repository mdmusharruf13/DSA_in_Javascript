/**
 * A tree is a hierarchial data structure that consist of nodes connected by edges.
 * A tree is a non linear ds, conpared to arrays, linked list, stack and queue which are linear ds.
 * In linear ds, the time req. to search is proportional to the size of the data set.
 * Tree however, woing to the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier to the data.
 * A tree will not contain any loop or cycles
